# SmallShop

If You Are Here Firstly i want to thank you 

beacuse you got to the wrong place 

but here my humble example for monorepo example where 

we make the tools we used every day like code libraries and frameworks (I didn't mean the abstract meaninig of framework 
so wait i will tell u the abstract meaning of framework when you go to your work late for two hour you screw things up beacuse you break some roles 

but the security guy will let you enter the building 

thats the framework some of restrictions and you can mess with them but if you screw this rule you are doing worng beacuse we use them becuse of tooling they supply us with

like ORMs for intract with data bases and And some abstract things like patterns for writing code concerns sperated in like MVC 

)

ok back to our Talk 

we made this mono repo approach to make things away seperate 

and hope this solve the problem 

but of course it will not
